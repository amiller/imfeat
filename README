imfeat: Image Feature Descriptor Library for Python

Goal: Standardize image feature descriptors to facilitate reuse

Definition of an Image Feature
- A python module that has a "make_features" function
- Takes a PIL image as it's argument
- It returns a list of image features (in the form of numpy arrays)
- List may contain zero, one, or many features
- If a fatal error occurs None will be returned (signifying that the feature cannot be computed on the provided image)
- For consistency, all Python modules adhering to the specification should use the _feature suffix.

def make_features(image):
    return ()
